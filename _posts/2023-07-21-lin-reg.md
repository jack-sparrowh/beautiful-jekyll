## 1. Few words about myself
I come from a background of Chemical Engineering, so for the good chunk of my life the linear regression was the REGLINP function in Excel, easy set and done. This is what i used during my university years. I always looked down on the linear regression, i thought it was so simple and not worthy of anyones time. I never knew how wrong i was. Over the past two years of self-study i grew to appreciate how beautiful the linear regression is, and most importantly, how complex it is. It was almost a spiritual experince (that humbled me to the core) to uncover completely new depth of this "simple" model, and it is all thanks to statistics. For this reason i recognise two types of linear regression, the one i used and neglected, and the statistical one. Thus the title of this blog. 

## 2. Notation
There are only handful of examples where authors use the notation for expected value i really love [... references...].
