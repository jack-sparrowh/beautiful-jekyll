My name is Przemysław Więcek and i have a Masters degree in Chemical Engineering. I'm good with crunching and flipping the numbers, or at least i'm trying. I really like spending time coding in python, deriving equations and learning. I'm trying to work my way through the introductory books into a field of mathematical logic and real analysis, to better understand the foundations of probability theory.

Here is a list of books i'm using and i used for self-study:

* Essential Calculus: Early Transcendentals, 2nd Edition By James Stewart,
* Introduction to Probability for Data Science By Stanley H. Chan,
* Probability, Random Variables, and Random Processes Theory and Signal Processing Applications, by John J. Shynk
* Linear Algebra and Its Applications, 6th edition By David C.Lay, Steven R.Lay, Judi J.McDonald.
* Spaces, An Introduction to Real Analysis by Tom L. Lindstrom,
* A First Course in Mathematical Logic and Set Theory by Michael L. O'Leary

What else do you need?

### My story

After graduating at Silesian Univeristy of Technology in Poland, i picked up the great "Thermodynamics An Engineering Approach" by Yunus A. Cengel, as thermodynamics was the only subject i couldn't understand (because lectures were so poorly prepared), so i wanted to learn it. As i was going throught the book i found CFD (computional fluid dynamics) engineering very interesting, and decided to pursue this career path. At some point i knew i had to learn programming in python, so i had found some courses at DataCamp and i felt in love with machine learning, since then all i do is to master the subject. It is fun, and is making me happy, so what else better to do than to work as a data scientist?
